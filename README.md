# Pokémon Orange

This is a ROM hack of Pokémon Crystal.

To patch the ROM, apply [**movie-2000-pss.ips**](patches/movie-2000-pss.ips) or [**movie-2000-no-pss.ips**](patches/movie-2000-no-pss.ips) to a clean Pokemon - Crystal Version (UE) (V1.0) [C][!].gbc ROM. (This is usually no longer recommended, see below)

For the latest version (usually recommended, but may have unknown bugs), download the latest nightly build from [**the releases tab**](https://github.com/PiaCarrot/pokeorange/releases/tag/beta-nightly).

If you would like the Physical-Special Split introduced in Generation 4, it is recommended to use the Movie-2000 build of the game. This is missing some of the newer music and some other changes, but there are some quirks and game breaking bugs in the nightly PSS builds. If you still want to experience the newer content, it is highly recommended to save frequently and make backups, you may also want to join the Discord in case you need support.

To build the ROM yourself, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

This hack is **not** complete. The latest build goes up to the Champion fight, with a postgame event based on Movie 2000. 

There will be bugs, please report any that you find over in the Discord server (to make things easier for everyone, please do a quick search to check if anyone else has reported that bug already!)
